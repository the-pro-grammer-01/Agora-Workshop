# Agora-Workshop

-- Homework 2 for Agora Workshop --

(Practice with javascript, some html and css)

A simple calculator. Focused more the on the javascript, so it doesn't resize as well as I'd like. Seems to do it's job well, however, so no complaints there.
Will likely revisit the project later.
